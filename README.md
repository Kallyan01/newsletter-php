## GitHub Timeline Update Application

### Problem

Develop a PHP application that periodically checks the GitHub timeline for updates and sends email notifications to subscribed users every five minutes. The application should include email verification to prevent misuse of email addresses and ensure that emails are formatted nicely with an unsubscribe link.

### Solution

To address the problem, we will create a PHP application that follows object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, utilizes PHP namespaces, and adheres to clean code concepts. The application will consist of the following components:

1. **Email Verification**: Implement a mechanism for email verification to validate the authenticity of user-provided email addresses.

2. **GitHub Timeline Feed**: Use a script to periodically send updates to the subscribed users 

3. **Email Notifications**: Upon detecting new updates on the GitHub timeline, the application will format email notifications nicely and send them to subscribed users. Each email will include an unsubscribe link for users to opt out of receiving further notifications.

4. **OOP Structure**: Organize the application's codebase using classes and objects to promote modularity, encapsulation, and maintainability.

5. **PHP Namespace**: Utilize PHP namespaces to avoid naming conflicts and enhance code organization within the application.

6. **Inline Documentation**: Ensure that all classes, methods, and significant code segments are well-documented with inline comments to enhance readability and understanding.

7. **Clean Code Concepts**: Adhere to clean code principles such as meaningful variable names, proper indentation, and modular code structure to facilitate code maintenance and readability.

### Requirements

To fulfill the assignment's requirements, the PHP application must meet the following criteria:

- Implement email verification to validate user-provided email addresses.
- Periodically monitor the GitHub timeline for updates, sending notifications to subscribed users every five minutes.
- Format email notifications nicely, allowing users to jump to different parts of the application easily.
- Include an unsubscribe link in each email to allow users to opt out of receiving further notifications.
- Follow object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, leveraging PHP namespaces for code organization.
- Provide proper inline documentation for classes, methods, and significant code segments.
- Adhere to PHP clean code concepts, ensuring code readability, maintainability, and modularity.

By meeting these requirements, the PHP application will effectively address the problem statement and provide a robust solution for sending GitHub timeline updates to subscribed users.
